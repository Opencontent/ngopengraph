Netgen Open Graph is an extension for eZ Publish CMS that allows simple
integration with Open Graph protocol, either official or compatible with Facebook.

Extension will, for configured classes, output Open Graph meta tags in the
page head. Those tags will be used by Facebook Like button to properly generate
corresponding Open Graph representations (nodes) in Facebook Open Graph tree.

All configuration is done through one ini file (ngopengraph.ini),
allowing for very simple and painless installation and flexible use.
